    message: Those of us who still live here call it the Poisoned Tundra, a wild
      place more the domain of monsters than humans now. Toxic rivers and streams
      cover most of this place, making it difficult and dangerous to traverse. It
      wasn't always like this you know.

    message: Back in the day it was lush and calm, it was beautiful green fields

    message: The change didn't happen overnight, and it gets worse each day, the
      water is now so dangerous it will burn your skin, even if you are sane enough
      to wear your pants. Last week I saw a crab the size of a truck chasing mutated
      frogs through the woods...
