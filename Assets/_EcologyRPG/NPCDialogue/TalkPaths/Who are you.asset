    subjectName: The Cleaner
    message: These days I call myself the Cleaner, and the few people who visit me
      call me the same. I had a proper name once, but no one has used it in so long
      that I can't remember it.

    subjectName: The Cleaner
    message: I maintain an industrial water purifier, it's enough to supply me with
      clean water everyday, provided I can get the toxic water to purify.

    subjectName: The Cleaner
    message: it's dangerous out there, so I tend to stay around here, eat what I
      can and live off the water I can purify, it's a valuable asset these days after
      all.
