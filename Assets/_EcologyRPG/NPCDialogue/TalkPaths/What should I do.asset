    message: I'd suggest securing a source of clean water, that'll help you stay
      alive, though it's not easy to find clean water around here. I can clean toxic
      water for you, but I can't five you everything you'll need.

    message: You might also want to get equipped, there are dangerous things out
      there, mutated frogs, giant crabs, and who knows what. You'll want a weapon
      and something to protect yourself.

    message: I can see you have some sort of water weapon, that'll help, but in general
      you should probably avoid confrontation if you can.
