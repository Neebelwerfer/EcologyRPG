    subjectName: The Cleaner
    message: If you want a constant supply of water, you need to get yourself a purifier.
      You can't have mine, but I know there is a small one, near the old factory.
      It should be in a red box with some tools. If you bring me the tools, I can
      help you install it at your base.
